# MyGov DAO
> EIP-2535 (Diamond pattern) DAO project.

MyGov DAO is a governance system for funding and community decisions.
It uses the Diamond Pattern to keep the contract modular and upgradeable, and has a React frontend built with Wagmi + RainbowKit + Shadcn/UI + TailwindCSS.

## Installing / Getting started

```shell
git clone https://github.com/abdarslan/mygov-dao.git
cd mygov-dao

# install contracts deps
cd contracts
npm install

cd ../frontend
npm install
```

## Developing
